  <h1>Absolutism</h1>
  <p>Absolutism embodies a political principle and practice centered on unrestricted centralized authority and complete sovereignty, primarily vested in a monarch or dictator. At its core, an absolutist system denotes that the governing power remains immune to regular challenge or oversight by any other entity—be it judicial, legislative, religious, economic, or electoral. King Louis XIV (1643–1715) of France famously epitomized absolutism with his statement, “L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”).

  Throughout history, absolutism has manifested in various incarnations across the globe. Notably, it prevailed in different forms, such as in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler and in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.
