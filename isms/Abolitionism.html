  <h1>Abolitionism</h1>
  <p>
Abolitionism, prominent in western Europe and the Americas, played a pivotal role in fostering the necessary sentiments to bring about an end to both the transatlantic slave trade and chattel slavery. The escalation of slavery as a prevailing system, triggered by Portuguese enslavement of Africans commencing in the 15th century, was primarily propelled by European colonies in North America, South America, and the West Indies. These regions' plantation economies fostered an insatiable demand for inexpensive labor.</p>

  <p>Throughout the span of the 16th to the 19th centuries, an estimated 12 million enslaved Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas. The undeniable brutality inherent in the institution of slavery, magnified by its extensive practice, evoked a profound reaction that vehemently advocated for its complete abolition.</p>
