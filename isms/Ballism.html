  <h1>Ballism</h1>
  <p>
    Ballism, in its medical context, is a rare neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, violent flinging or throwing motions of the limbs, often unilateral (hemiballismus). It arises due to dysfunction or damage to the subthalamic nucleus of the brain caused by conditions like stroke, trauma, infections, or metabolic abnormalities affecting the central nervous system. Symptoms include uncontrollable and forceful movements, impacting daily functioning. Treatment involves medication, surgery, and rehabilitation therapies aiming to manage symptoms and address the underlying cause.
