  <h1>Absurdism</h1>
  <p>
    Absurdism is a philosophical belief asserting the inherent meaninglessness, irrationality, or chaos of existence. It explores the tension between humanity's search for meaning and the inability to find any, often through the lens of absurdity and existential questioning.
