  <h1>Lamarckism</h1>
  <p>
    Lamarckism, named after Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, proposed an early theory of evolution suggesting that acquired traits during an organism's lifetime could be passed down to its offspring. However, this theory was largely supplanted by Darwin's theory of natural selection.
