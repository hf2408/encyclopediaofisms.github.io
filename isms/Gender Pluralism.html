  <h1>Gender Pluralism</h1>
  <p>
    Gender Pluralism advocates for recognizing and accepting a spectrum of genders beyond the traditional binary understanding of gender. It promotes inclusivity and acknowledges that gender identity is diverse, encompassing various expressions and identities beyond male and female.
