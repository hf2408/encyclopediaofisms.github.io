  <h1>Darwinism</h1>
  <p>
    Darwinism refers to the theory of evolution by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. It explains the process of biological evolution, suggesting that species evolve over time through the mechanisms of natural selection, adaptation, and genetic variation, driving the diversity of life on Earth.
