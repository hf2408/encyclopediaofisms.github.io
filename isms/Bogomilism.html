  <h1>Bogomilism</h1>
  <p>
    Bogomilism was a Christian dualist religious movement that emerged in the Middle Ages, originating in the Balkans. It espoused beliefs in a cosmic struggle between good and evil, rejecting the material world as the creation of the devil, and emphasizing spiritual purity and asceticism.
