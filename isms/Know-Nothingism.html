  <h1>Know-Nothingism</h1>
  <p>
    Know-Nothingism was a 19th-century nativist American political movement characterized by anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiments. It sought to restrict immigration and naturalization and promoted an exclusionary agenda based on nativism and perceived American Protestant values.
