  <h1>Arianism</h1>
  <p>
    Arianism was an early Christian theological belief associated with Arius, which asserted that Jesus Christ, while divine, was a created being and not co-eternal or consubstantial with God the Father. It was deemed heretical by the Nicene Creed and many Christian denominations.
