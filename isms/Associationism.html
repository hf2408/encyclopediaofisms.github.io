  <h1>Associationism</h1>
  <p>
    Associationism is a psychological theory or doctrine suggesting that complex mental processes, such as learning, memory, and perception, result from the association of simple ideas or sensations. It proposes that connections and associations between mental elements form the basis of higher cognitive functions.
