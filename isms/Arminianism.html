  <h1>Arminianism</h1>
  <p>
    Arminianism is a theological stance associated with Jacobus Arminius, emphasizing human free will, conditional election, and the possibility of resisting divine grace. It contrasts with Calvinism on certain theological points, particularly concerning predestination and the extent of divine sovereignty.
