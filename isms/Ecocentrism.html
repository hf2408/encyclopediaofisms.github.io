  <h1>Ecocentrism</h1>
  <p>
    Ecocentrism is an ethical perspective that places intrinsic value on the entire natural world, considering ecosystems and all living organisms as inherently valuable. It contrasts with anthropocentrism, focusing on the importance of preserving the environment and biodiversity for their own sake rather than solely for human benefit.
