  <h1>Arbitrarism</h1>
  <p>
    Arbitrarism is a philosophical position that asserts the absence of inherent or objective meaning, value, or truth in things, suggesting that these aspects are assigned or determined by human decisions, preferences, or social conventions rather than being intrinsically present.
