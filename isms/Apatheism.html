  <h1>Apatheism</h1>
  <p>
    Apatheism refers to a lack of interest or concern regarding the existence or non-existence of deities. It's a position of apathy or indifference towards religious beliefs or questions about the divine. Apatheists may not actively reject or accept the concept of gods but are generally uninterested in the subject.
