  <h1>Balkanism</h1>
  <p>
    Balkanism refers to the historical tendency of Western perceptions to oversimplify and stereotype the Balkan region of southeastern Europe. These biased views often portray the Balkans as a region perpetually plagued by ethnic conflicts, backwardness, and exoticism. Such oversimplified perspectives overlook the rich cultural diversity and complex histories of the Balkan countries, impacting geopolitics, literature, and media representations.
