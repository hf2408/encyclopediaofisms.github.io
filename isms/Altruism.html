  <h1>Altruism</h1>
  <p>Altruism embodies the principle of prioritizing the well-being and happiness of others, whether humans or animals, over oneself. It stands as a significant moral value across diverse cultures and religions, often synonymous with selflessness and a stark contrast to selfishness.</p>

  <p>The term "altruism" gained prominence, perhaps even originating, through French philosopher Auguste Comte, who introduced "altruisme" as an antithesis to egoism. Comte derived it from the Italian "altrui," itself stemming from the Latin "alteri," signifying "other people" or "somebody else."</p>

  <p>In observing populations of organisms, altruism manifests when an individual undertakes actions that incur personal costs (such as reduced pleasure, quality of life, time, or diminished survival and reproductive prospects) to benefit another, directly or indirectly, without expecting reciprocation or compensation for these actions.</p>
