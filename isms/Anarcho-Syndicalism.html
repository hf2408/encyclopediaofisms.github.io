  <h1>Anarcho-Syndicalism</h1>
  <p>
    Anarcho-Syndicalism is a theory of anarchism that advocates for the organization of society along decentralized, self-managed labor unions or syndicates. It aims to create a society without hierarchical structures, where workers control the means of production through direct action and collective ownership.
