  <h1>Radical Skepticism</h1>
  <p>
    Radical skepticism, also known as radical scepticism in British English, is the philosophical position asserting that knowledge is highly improbable or impossible. Advocates of radical skepticism contend that doubt exists regarding the truthfulness of every belief, and therefore, absolute certainty is never justified.
