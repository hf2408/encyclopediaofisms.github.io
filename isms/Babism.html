  <h1>Babism</h1>
  <p>
    Babism emerged in 19th-century Persia, founded by Mirza Ali Muhammad, known as the Bab. It promoted the oneness of God, equality among all humanity, and the need for spiritual renewal in society. The Bab claimed to be a divine messenger heralding the arrival of another figure greater than himself. Despite severe persecution and the execution of the Bab, his followers continued the movement, which later evolved into the Baha'i Faith, emphasizing unity, equality, and shared spiritual principles among religions.
