  <h1>Anti-Theism</h1>
  <p>
    Anti-Theism represents a philosophical stance or belief system that actively opposes or rejects the existence of deities or gods. Unlike atheism, which simply denotes a lack of belief in gods, anti-theism goes further by advocating against religious institutions, practices, and theism itself. It often involves criticism of organized religion, religious doctrines, and their perceived negative impacts on society, ethics, and individual autonomy. Anti-theists might assert that religion is harmful, divisive, or impedes progress, and they might actively work to diminish or eradicate religious influence in various spheres of life.
