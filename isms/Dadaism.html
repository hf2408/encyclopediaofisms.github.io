  <h1>Dadaism</h1>
  <p>
    Dadaism was an avant-garde art movement of the early 20th century, characterized by its rejection of traditional aesthetic principles. It embraced absurdity, irrationality, and spontaneity in art, literature, and performance. Dadaists aimed to challenge societal norms, criticizing the rationality that they believed had led to the devastation of World War I.
