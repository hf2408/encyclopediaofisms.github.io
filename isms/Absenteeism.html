  <h1>Absenteeism</h1>
  <p>Absence from duties without valid justification defines absenteeism, typically involving unplanned nonattendance. This behavior is often perceived as a sign of subpar individual performance and a breach of the implicit agreement between an employee and their employer. It's commonly regarded as a management challenge and frequently addressed through economic perspectives. However, contemporary research aims to interpret absenteeism as a reflection of psychological, medical, or social adjustments in the workplace.</p>

  <p>Numerous factors contribute to excessive absenteeism, such as dissatisfaction with the job, ongoing personal struggles, or chronic health issues. Regardless of the cause, prolonged absenteeism can harm an individual's professional reputation, potentially jeopardizing their long-term career prospects. It's essential to note that certain types of absences are legally protected and cannot serve as grounds for termination.</p>
